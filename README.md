## California Housing Values (1990 Data):
### houses_rmd.html - Displaying a map of California with housing values superimposed, the effect of median income, and pair/correlation plots of the following variables:  housing values, median income, household, avg_population , avg_totalrooms, and avg_total_bedrooms.  U.S. Government shapefiles are used to depict Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and the MSAs are colour-coded to represent housing values in California. 
### houses.txt -- raw dataset containing the California Housing Values
### github_house_values_cal.py - generates a geospatial graph of California with the 1990 Housing Values superimposed
### houses_eda2.R -- R code to generate pair/correlation plots and ggplots of the house values against the median income.
### cal_houses_gamma.ipynb: Python code within a Jupyter NB modifying the raw data on housing values, constructing a modelling data set with NaN entries, imputing the NaN values, cross-validating the data and constructing a GLM with a gamma response. Commentaries on the validation of the model are given. 
### California_Housing_Bagging_vs_RForests.ipynb : A Jupyter NB comparing Bagging and Random Forests for the 1990 California Housing Data. There is also a section where 'ensemble' methods are used to compare Random Forests, Gradient Boosting and the AdaBoost method.
